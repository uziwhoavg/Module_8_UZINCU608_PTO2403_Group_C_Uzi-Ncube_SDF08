# [SDF08] Build Your Portfolio MVP


* An MVP, or "Minimum Viable Product," is commonly used in startup and product development. It refers to the most basic version of a product that allows a team to launch with the smallest possible investment of time and money. Yet, it's functional enough to satisfy the initial users and begin the process of collecting feedback.

 

* In relation to a new developer's portfolio website, an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) refers to the most basic yet functional version of the portfolio that effectively showcases your skills, projects, and background. For a portfolio MVP, this typically means:

    * Essential Pages and Content: At its core, the MVP might include a landing page, an about section, projects or works showcase, and a contact method. Other sections can be added later as the developer gains more experience or content to showcase.
    * Clarity Over Flair: While it might be tempting to integrate complex animations or unique layouts, an MVP focuses on presenting information clearly and concisely. A clean, straightforward design is prioritised over intricate design details.
    * Responsive Design: The portfolio should be viewable and functional across various devices, especially mobile devices and desktops, even if not optimised to the fullest extent possible.
    * Key Projects: The portfolio should display a selection of the developer's most essential or impressive projects. As the developer works on more projects, they can expand this section.
    * Contact Information: An MVP portfolio should make it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out, even if it's just a basic contact form or listed email address.
 

* The idea behind an MVP for a portfolio is to quickly create something online that effectively communicates your skills and experience. As you grow in your learning journey and career, you can iterate on and enhance your portfolio, but an MVP allows you to start showcasing yourself without waiting for perfection.
